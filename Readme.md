# Manuscripts: GSoC'18

The [manuscripts project](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-manuscripts) is part of the grimoirelab toolset and is used to produce Reports based on enriched elasticsearch indices.

This repository has been set up to track the status of the work that is being done on the Manuscripts project under Google Summer of Code 18.

### Coordination procedures:

We will be discussing about the progress of this project every `Wednesday at 13:00 CEST or 16:30 IST` at the `
#grimoirelab` channel on [**FREENODE IRC**](https://webchat.freenode.net/). The transcripts of the meetings (chats) are available in the [`IRC-transcripts`](https://github.com/aswanipranjal/gsoc-manuscripts/tree/master/IRC-transcripts) folder. 
There will also be a weekly [blog post](https://aswanipranjal.github.io/posts/), every tuesday night/wednesday morning, detailing what I did that week, the challenges I faced and the amazing things that I learned.
I will also be posting the summary of the week's meeting on the [mailing lists](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/oss-health-metrics) of CHAOSS. Along with a small writeup of what I plan to do the coming week.
The Growth-Maturity-Decline Work Group is working on defining the GMD metrics in a better way and trying ways to implement them. They have a weekly zoom meeting at `18:00 CEST`, every `Thursday`. You can join via this [zoom link](https://unomaha.zoom.us/j/720431288).
We are planning to keep all the communication open so that everyone is free to participate and help us grow! Hence all the Issues and PRs made for this project will be listed here.
